I'm a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Chicago. My interests are broad, and range from Algebraic Geometry and Representation Theory (which has been my research focus up until recently) to Probability Theory and Machine Learning. I enjoy coffee, a good movie and riding the bike on a sunny day.
